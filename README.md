PyNN, a ANN project that will hopefully evolve into something more.

The project was made using the Anaconda python distribution.

Installation instructions:
- Install the Anaconda python distribution and install it, the instructions are available from "http://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/".
- Create a new python environment with "conda create --name pynn python=3.6".
- Activate that environment "source activate pynn".
- Install the OpenCV and Numba packages in the environment with the "conda install -c conda-forge numba opencv" command.
- Download the code, extract it and change directory to it.
- Run it with "python main.py".
- Feel free to play around with it, edit it, contribute if you'd like.
- You can follow the API documentation or code comments to accomplish what you want to do and if you can't, code or documentation contributions are very welcome.
